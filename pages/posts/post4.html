                <p>
                    In Dota 2, two teams of five players are matched against each other on a map with two different
                    bases that need to be occupied or defended. Before every match each player gets to choose a powerful
                    character from a big roster of 115 different “Heroes”, all with different abilities, strengths and weaknesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the game, players collect experience points to level up their characters by performing different
                    feats, such as killing another hero or progressing closer towards the enemy base by killing defense towers.
                    According to their performance, players can collect and earn gold. This is a very vital part of the game as
                    earning gold will allow you to buy items for your character that can vastly improve your characters’
                    effectiveness. The first team to destroy the opposing team’s base will be crowned winners.
                </p>

                <h2>How To Play Dota 2 ? </h2>
                <p>
                    The main goal of Dota 2 is to destroy the enemy’s ancient building, which is the biggest building inside of your
                    team’s base, and by doing this you’ll win the game. The two different teams need to pick one individual hero to
                    play during the entire match. It’s important for players to pick a character you are willing to stick to, because
                    once you’ve picked your hero there’s no turning back until the next game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The map has 3 different lanes (left, mid and right) that leads from one team’s base to the other. Players then
                    decide with their teammates which of their lanes will be your focus at the start of the game. In these lanes, players
                    will run into defense towers and non-player characters (creeps) which need to be killed to gather experience points and
                    gold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By killing these creeps and destroying defense towers, you’ll help your team to progress closer to the enemy base.
                    As a player focusing on a lane, as is the enemy team, this is where the player versus player action begins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All heroes are very weak at the beginning of each game, hence the importance of gathering experience and gold. The
                    experience points are used to level up your character and when leveling up you can acquire new abilities or upgrade
                    the ones you already have. With gold, you can buy items that can give you a higher damage power, quicker run speed
                    or similar and the more expensive items can even grant you extra abilities that can help you turn the battlefield
                    into your favour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, to gather gold from the creeps, you need to be the player that does the killing blow. If you don’t get the
                    killing blow, no gold will be awarded. You can also deny your enemies their killing blows on your own creeps by making
                    sure that you kill them yourself, just before the enemy hero is lining up a killing blow. This is an amazing way of denying
                    your enemy gold, but also experience as only 70% of the creeps regular experience will be rewarded to your enemies, and the
                    remaining 30% will be rewarded to your team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, early in game, focusing on getting last hits on creeps and denying your enemies to farm gold and experience is a great
                    way of gaining a huge advantage in the game. This is due to heroes being weak in the early game, and if one of the team manages
                    to get one or two levels above their opponents it’s very easy to continue to slay them as your willpower increases at a higher
                    rate than your enemies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is often referred to as “snowballing”, since you are taking advantage of being the more powerful hero and utilizing this
                    momentum to keep growing stronger. One good way for the enemy team to hinder a snowballing hero is to put a lot of effort in
                    making sure that the hero gets killed. By killing a hero with a strong gold grind or a hero that’s on a kill streak, the rewards
                    are higher than normal which gives the team a small opportunity to catch up and even out the odds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you, as a player are unfortunate enough to end up in a lane where the enemy hero is starting to snowball, you could be the
                    one that enables him to do this. This is called “feeding” and is one of the worst things you can do in the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you notice that you have begun to “feed” the enemy hero by allowing him to continuously kill you, you need to make some
                    changes to your play style and either ask for help from your teammates to rush your lane and help you end the enemies’ killing
                    spree, or you simply need to make sure to not engage in fights you don’t believe you can win. Sometimes running away can be a
                    much better strategy than to pick fights you’re not comfortable in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After this early stage of the game it’s time for “Mid game”. This is when the team try to make efforts to push their lanes and
                    get rid of as many defense towers as possible. It’s also pretty common that players start to try “ganking” enemy heroes by leaving
                    their lanes and try their best to flank the enemy heroes by coming up behind them and attack them together at the same time to get
                    quick kills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a great way to get some more map control and push further into your lanes. But be careful, if you leave your lane to gank
                    another, you are leaving your own lane without proper defence, and the enemy could also use this as a counter to push your lane
                    closer to your base.
                </p>
